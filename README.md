This is a presentation given by Justine Bernshine (me) and Shivani Tyagi for our Parallel Computing class.
It is based off [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167819116000041) paper: "Hybrid MPI-thread parallelization of adaptive mesh operations" by Dan Ibanez, Ian Dunn, and Mark S.Shephard
